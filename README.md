Problem statement: To design a web portal for students to ask queries and enroll for online courses developed by mentors.


Objective: To develop a common platform for students to communicate with experts and gain knowledge about their fields of interests.

To discuss queries or problems in the process of learning. Enroll for free courses.

Applications:

•	Students and mentors can answer one another's questions, thus reducing your support costs. 

•	If a user answers someone's question — especially with a detailed response 

— this information can be referenced in the future, so you don't have to recreate it every time someone sends you the same question. 
•	As users discuss your offerings, they are generating, for free, fresh content that is rich in keywords and is attractive to search engines. 

•	By having an online community, users are encouraged to visit your website more often, and then they tell others about it. 

•	Users will typically and freely share ideas on how you could improve your offerings, market them better, and reach new prospects.
