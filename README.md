Applications:

•	If a user answers someone's question — especially with a detailed response 

— this information can be referenced in the future, so you don't have to recreate it every time someone sends you the same question. 
•	As users discuss your offerings, they are generating, for free, fresh content that is rich in keywords and is attractive to search engines. 

•	By having an online community, users are encouraged to visit your website more often, and then they tell others about it. 

•	Users will typically and freely share ideas on how you could improve your offerings, market them better, and reach new prospects.
